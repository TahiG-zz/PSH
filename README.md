# PSH

### _How might we create an single-purpose app with viral potential?_

## What
PSH is inspired by the rise of apps like **Yo!** by Or Arbel and **HQTrivia**.

PSH is a single-purpose, single button app for iOS and Android. It has one button in the cenre of the screen. Users push the button and are treated to a different viral content experience every day. This includes funny videos, images and GIFs.

## How
PSH has a heavy focus on design and intuitive user experience. 
The app leverages the best in UX/UI, visual FX and haptic feedback to deliver the most satisfying experience to users.
The app will be ad free and free to download.

## Who
### Primary Users:
- 14-28 year olds
- Moderately tech-savvy
- Inner city
- Multi-Cultural


#### Partnerships:
Via brand partnerships, PSH could give users early/exclusive access to:
- pre-release music

PSH was originally dreamt up by myself and digital designer Wilson Lam. It is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution licence.
